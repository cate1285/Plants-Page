        <h2>Learn to recognize when houseplants need water</h2>
        <p>In general, <strong>you should be more concerned with over-watering than under-watering</strong>; most houseplants are better off slightly dry than sopping wet. The goal is to provide your plants with enough water to keep the soil moist but not soggy (with succulents being a notable exception to this rule—they require periodic soakings). Pour water slowly into the potting soil until it trickles out from the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. Most plants only need to be watered once or twice a week, and less during the winter months. An easy way to check if your plant needs a drink is to stick your finger two inches deep into the soil. If it feels dry, then it's most likely time to water.
        </p>
        <h2>Be aware of temperature, humidity, and ventilation</h2>

        	In general, houseplants require a level of humidity similar to that of their natural growing conditions. Air plants (of the genus Tillandsia) take in all their water from the air and thus require regular misting with a spray bottle.
            For other houseplants, condensation that stays on leaves too long can be harmful, which is why proper airflow is crucial for healthy plants. Placing a fan near your houseplants to circulate air can evaporate excess moisture and prevent dust buildup on leaves.
        </p>
                 
        <h2>Ensure that your houseplants get the right amount of light.</h2>
        <p>All plants need light energy for photosynthesis, but different houseplants require different amounts of light. With the exception of desert cacti and other succulents, most houseplants need indirect light rather than direct light. Houseplants that thrive in indirect light grow well near west-facing windows or—for plants that require bright light but not direct sun—a few feet back from south-facing windows. Plants that survive in especially shady, low-light conditions and flourish indoors include ZZ plant, snake plant, pothos, and philodendron; these plants can grow in north and east-facing windows. Some houseplants require artificial light to grow indoors, especially during the winter months and in certain regions where there are fewer hours of light. Normal household light bulbs are not effective in providing light to houseplants, so you'll need to purchase fluorescent or LED grow lights, which have full-spectrum bulbs that provide a balance of cool and warm light to mimic the natural solar spectrum.
        </p>
        <h3>Choosing the right plant for your available light.</h3>
        <h4>Low Light.</h4>
        <p>A low-light plant would be suitable for a north window or a fairly dark corner.
        Low-light plants require little to no direct light. In their native growing environments, these plants are “understory plants” meaning they grow underneath the branches of larger plants.
        Low lighting is not sufficient for starting seeds indoors.
        In environments with less light, plants grow more slowly and use less water. Avoid overwatering by feeling the soil.
        </p>
        <h4>Medium light</h4>
        <p>A medium-light plant would be suitable for east-facing windows or located near a west-facing window, but out of direct light, you would need artificial lighting for starting seeds in medium light.
        Like the low light plants, these plants will not dry out as quickly. Avoid overwatering by feeling the soil.
        </p>

        <h4>High light</h4>
        <p>A high-light plant would be suitable for brightly lit locations such as south- or southwest-facing windows.
        You may be able to start seeds without artificial lighting, but seeds that need more time indoors, such as tomatoes and peppers, may become leggy without extra light.
        High-light areas can be warm, making plants dry out faster. Check these plants more frequently and water when soil is dry.
